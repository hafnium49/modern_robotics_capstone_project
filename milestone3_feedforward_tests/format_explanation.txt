# Corrected format for CoppeliaSim Scene 6 compatibility
# Format: chassis_phi, chassis_x, chassis_y, J1, J2, J3, J4, J5, W1, W2, W3, W4, gripper_state

# Example of correct format (this would be generated by your simulation):
0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.2, -1.6, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0
0.01, 0.001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.01, -0.19, -1.59, 0.01, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0
0.02, 0.002, 0.002, 0.02, 0.02, -0.18, -1.58, 0.02, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0

# Your current file has rotation matrices which are completely incompatible
# with Scene 6's expected format of:
# - Single chassis angle (not 3x3 rotation matrix)
# - Joint angles J1-J5 (missing from your file)
# - Wheel angles W1-W4 (missing from your file)
