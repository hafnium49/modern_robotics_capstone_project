Milestone 3 Feedforward Control Test Report
==================================================

Test Files Generated:
- feedforward_perfect_initial.csv: Perfect initial end-effector position
- feedforward_small_error.csv: Small initial error (5cm, 2cm, 1cm)
- feedforward_medium_error.csv: Medium initial error (10cm, 5cm, 2cm)
- feedforward_large_error.csv: Large initial error (20cm, 10cm, 5cm)

Instructions:
1. Load any of the CSV files in CoppeliaSim Scene 6
2. Run the simulation to observe feedforward control behavior
3. Compare performance between different initial error conditions
4. Note: Feedforward control shows how trajectory following works
   without error correction, demonstrating the importance of accurate
   initial conditions and feedforward terms.
