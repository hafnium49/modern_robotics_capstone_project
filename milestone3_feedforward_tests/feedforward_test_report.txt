Milestone 3 Feedforward Control Test Report
==================================================

Test Files Generated:
- feedforward_perfect_initial.csv: Perfect initial end-effector position
- feedforward_small_error.csv: Small initial error (5cm, 2cm, 1cm)
- feedforward_medium_error.csv: Medium initial error (10cm, 5cm, 2cm)
- feedforward_large_error.csv: Large initial error (20cm, 10cm, 5cm)

Testing Instructions:
1. Load each CSV file in CoppeliaSim Scene 8
2. Set cube initial position to (1, 0, 0.025) with 0° rotation
3. Set cube goal position to (0, -1, 0.025) with -90° rotation
4. Run simulation and observe robot behavior

Expected Results:
- perfect_initial: Should follow trajectory closely, pick and place cube
- small_error: Small deviation but should still complete task
- medium_error: Larger deviation, may not grasp cube perfectly
- large_error: Significant deviation, likely to miss cube

Key Observations:
- Feedforward control cannot correct for initial errors
- Errors persist throughout the trajectory
- Larger initial errors lead to larger trajectory deviations
- This demonstrates the need for feedback control in Milestone 3
