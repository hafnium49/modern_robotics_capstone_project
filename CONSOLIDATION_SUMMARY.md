# Function Consolidation Summary

## âœ… **Consolidation Completed Successfully!**

### What Was Done:

1. **Enhanced `run_capstone_simulation` function** with new parameter:
   - Added `feedforward_only=False` parameter
   - When `feedforward_only=True`:
     - Forces `use_perfect_initial=True`
     - Sets `Kp = Ki = zeros` (pure feedforward)
     - Adjusts print messages to match old function style
     - Includes performance summary output

2. **Removed duplicate code**:
   - Eliminated the entire `run_perfect_feedforward_simulation` function body (~100 lines)
   - All functionality now consolidated into single function

3. **Maintained backward compatibility**:
   - Created `run_perfect_feedforward_simulation` as an alias/wrapper
   - Existing imports and function calls continue to work unchanged
   - Function marked as deprecated with guidance to use new approach

### Benefits Achieved:

- **âœ… Code Reduction**: ~100 lines of duplicate code eliminated
- **âœ… Easier Maintenance**: Only one function to update and test
- **âœ… Consistent Behavior**: No risk of functions diverging
- **âœ… Backward Compatibility**: Existing code continues to work
- **âœ… Improved API**: Single function handles all simulation scenarios

### Test Results:

```
Feedforward (new): 0.462648 m
Feedforward (old): 0.462648 m  
Feedback:          0.220792 m
âœ… Backward compatibility PERFECT - identical results!
```

### Usage Examples:

```python
# New unified approach - feedforward only
run_capstone_simulation(Tsc_init, Tsc_goal, Tce_grasp, Tce_standoff, 
                       feedforward_only=True)

# New unified approach - feedback control  
run_capstone_simulation(Tsc_init, Tsc_goal, Tce_grasp, Tce_standoff, 
                       Kp=my_gains, Ki=my_gains)

# Old function still works (calls new function internally)
run_perfect_feedforward_simulation(Tsc_init, Tsc_goal, Tce_grasp, Tce_standoff)
```

### Files Affected:
- âœ… `code/run_capstone.py` - Consolidated and improved
- âœ… Existing test files continue to work unchanged
- âœ… All imports remain valid

**The consolidation is complete and your codebase is now cleaner and more maintainable!** ðŸš€
