# CSV Format Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The feedforward CSV files in `milestone3_feedforward_tests/` were in **catastrophically wrong format** for CoppeliaSim Scene 6:
- Contained SE(3) transformation matrices (9 rotation elements)
- Incompatible with Scene 6 requirements for robot configurations
- Would not work in CoppeliaSim simulations

## Solution Implemented
Completely rewrote the feedforward CSV generation in `test_milestone3.py` to:

### 1. Use `run_capstone.py` for Proper CSV Generation
- Modified `test_generate_feedforward_csv_files()` to use `run_capstone_simulation()`
- Creates different control gain scenarios (perfect, small error, medium error, large error)
- Generates proper robot configurations instead of end-effector poses

### 2. Scene 6 Compatible Format
The new CSV files contain **13 columns** in the correct format:
```
[chassis_phi, chassis_x, chassis_y, J1, J2, J3, J4, J5, W1, W2, W3, W4, gripper_state]
```

### 3. Updated Test Functions
Modified these functions to use the new approach:
- `test_feedforward_only_perfect_initial()`
- `test_feedforward_with_initial_error()`
- `test_feedforward_trajectory_following()`

## Results
- **All 4 feedforward CSV files regenerated**: 3003 timesteps each
- **Proper robot configurations**: Joint angles and wheel velocities
- **Scene 6 compatible**: 13-column format verified
- **Joint limits enforced**: Conservative limits applied during generation
- **Test validation**: All tests pass with new format

## Files Updated
- `code/tests/test_milestone3.py`: Complete rewrite of CSV generation logic
- `milestone3_feedforward_tests/feedforward_*.csv`: All regenerated with correct format

## Key Benefits
✅ **CoppeliaSim Compatible**: Files now work with Scene 6  
✅ **Proper Data**: Robot configurations instead of poses  
✅ **Joint Limits**: Conservative limits enforced during generation  
✅ **Validated**: All tests pass with verification  
✅ **Consistent**: All feedforward tests use same approach  

The CSV format crisis has been **completely resolved** - all feedforward test files are now properly formatted for CoppeliaSim Scene 6 compatibility.
