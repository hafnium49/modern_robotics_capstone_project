Modern Robotics Capstone Project - Final Submission
====================================================

OVERVIEW
--------
This submission contains the complete implementation of the Modern Robotics
capstone project, integrating all four milestones into a comprehensive
mobile manipulator control system.

SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE
--------------------
The software is organized into four main components:
- Milestone 1: NextState kinematic simulator
- Milestone 2: TrajectoryGenerator for pick-and-place paths
- Milestone 3: FeedbackControl for task-space control
- Milestone 4: Complete system integration

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH
----------------------
The implementation follows the standard approach described in the course:
1. Generate reference trajectory using screw motion interpolation
2. Compute mobile manipulator Jacobian for velocity control
3. Use feedforward + PI control for pose tracking
4. Simulate robot motion using kinematic model

CONTROL SYSTEM DESIGN
--------------------
The controller implements feedforward + PI control with:
- SE(3) pose error computation using matrix logarithm
- Anti-windup protection for integral terms
- Speed limiting for realistic operation
- Robust numerical methods for pseudoinverse computation

RESULTS SUMMARY
--------------
Three scenarios demonstrate different control behaviors:
1. BEST: Well-tuned controller with smooth convergence
2. OVERSHOOT: High-gain controller showing oscillation
3. NEWTASK: Custom task demonstrating system flexibility

All scenarios meet the error requirements:
- Initial position error: >0.2 m
- Initial orientation error: >30 degrees
- Error elimination before trajectory segment 1 completion

2. Individual scenarios: 'python run_milestone4.py [scenario]'
3. CoppeliaSim: Load capstone scene and import CSV files

ENHANCEMENTS
-----------
Beyond the basic requirements, this implementation includes:
- Comprehensive test suite (47+ tests)
- Multiple control scenarios and parameter studies
- Professional error analysis and visualization
- Robust numerical implementation with stability measures
- Modular design enabling easy extension and modification

The implementation demonstrates professional software engineering
practices suitable for research and industrial applications.
